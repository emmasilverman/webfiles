      <p> My name is Emma Rae <em>(she/her/hers)</em>, here are some things you should know about me...</p>
      <p>I am a senior at the University of Colorado at Boulder studying Strategic Communications in the Public Relations track and minoring in Creative Technology Design, which has brought me here! I'm from New Jersey and I came to Boulder to slow down and spend some time outdoors in a relaxed environment. I like to snowboard, I enjoy taking photos, and love hands-on art</p>
